this project was focused on creating my own personal portfolio - the final product is a portfolio based off a user's github. It leverages the github API to output information about their profile and repos.

The implemented features are the following:
- get all the repos of the user
  - including their description
  - the main language used
- get user info
  - location
  - bio
  - profile picture
  - number of repos 
- the languages the user has used
- statistic of languages
- recent activities 

## Future Implementation

- integrate LinkedIn API
